## Project in Bachelors
### Vehicle Detection using Machine Deep learning
- The project focuses on Vehicle Detection, Tracking and Counting with machine learning.
- It is focused to develop the features of detect multiple vehicles in highway roads simultaneously, Vehicle
colour classification and recognition of approximate vehicle colour.
- Despite the abundant information collected by cameras surrounding us, little of it is processed and
understood by machines. By using the technologies of OCV, ML, MDL the project explains the detection,
direction, speed, colour of vehicles. 

## Term Project
### Employee Management System
The name itself shows that we are doing a project on how to assist the newly hired employee from hiring
(onboarding process) and to assist the organization to locate specific employees' complete records within 
a business. To manage and maintain all the data in one place this web based application is created to help 
the organization and human resource team. We are using python as front backend, Angular JS as front end 
and SQL as database. I believe that this project really helps new employees to make onboarding easy.
